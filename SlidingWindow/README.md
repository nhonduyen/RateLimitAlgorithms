This type of rate limiter is useful for controlling the rate of requests or operations over a given time period, while providing a smoother distribution compared to fixed window rate limiters.

Use cases for sliding window rate limiters:

API Rate Limiting: Control the number of API calls a client can make within a given time frame.
Preventing Brute Force Attacks: Limit login attempts or other security-sensitive operations.
Traffic Shaping: Manage the load on your servers by controlling incoming request rates.
Spam Prevention: Limit the rate of user actions like posting comments or sending messages.
Resource Allocation: Control access to limited resources in a multi-tenant system.
Cost Control: Limit usage of paid external services to stay within budget constraints.
Database Query Throttling: Prevent database overload by limiting query rates.
Email Sending: Control the rate of outgoing emails to prevent being flagged as spam.
